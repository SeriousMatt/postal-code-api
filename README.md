# Postal-code-api

A Node.js + Express API that serves the GeoNameâ€™s Postal Code file for the US. The file data is imported into a PostgreSQL database and queried to build the results. Two API endpoint(s) exist:

1. Find a single place by zip code (f.e. http://localhost:3000/postcodes/76579)

2. Find all of the zip codes in a state, including a way to paginate through the results (f.e. http://localhost:3000/states/TX?page=1&limit=12).

Pure postal awesomeness.
